# Hamming-Huffman-Project
This GitHub repository hosts a Java project that provides a comprehensive solution for file management, focusing on both security and compression functionalities. The project leverages Java Swing for its user interface.

**Features:**
1. **File Protection:** Utilizing Hamming code, the application allows users to protect and unprotect text files (txt) based on various block configurations. This includes the option to introduce or simulate errors for robust testing scenarios.

2. **File Compression:** The project supports the compression and decompression of both text (txt) and Word (docx) files using Huffman coding. This feature enhances file storage efficiency without compromising data integrity.

**Key Components:**
- **Hamming Code Module:** Implements the Hamming code algorithm for secure file protection with configurable block sizes.

- **Huffman Coding Module:** Manages the compression and decompression processes using Huffman coding, optimizing file storage.

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Explore the user-friendly Java Swing interface to protect, unprotect, compress, and decompress files.
